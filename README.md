# This is the H&E Image Classifier pipeline

The pipeline has been taken from Nick Trahearn's code and adapted to work with the ICR H&E Image Classifier web-app.

A version of the cell classifier can be found here:

Within this repo, you can find the bash script containing the key parameters is here:

Before classification, there are a few of pre-processing steps you have to run. The code for those can be found here:
